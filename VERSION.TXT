   com.liberty.rtk.util.VGRSPuny wrapper class
   for easy punycode manipulation of domain names.

liberty-rtk-addon-0.3.0 - Sept 10, 2003

 + Created RGPRenew extension (and example) for the 
   .info registry (com.liberty.rtk.addon.RGPRenew).
 + Created new legacy_src to house the "unspec" addon
   src to be compiled against 0.3.x Java RTK releases.

   The original liberty-rtk-addon.jar file is for users
   of the 0.7.x and greater lines of Java RTKs (must be
   at least 0.7.4).  If using the 0.3.x line, 0.3.11 
   or great is required.

liberty-rtk-addon-0.2.2 - May 5, 2003

 + Fix to DomainProtocol extension to be a little

 + Also make it assume a default value of "epp" if
   the extension is not found as per .org registry
   policy.
 + Fix to the xml elements in the oxrs transfer class
   to prevent xerces from erroring out about namespace
   stuff

liberty-rtk-addon-0.2.1 - April 16, 2003

 + Added DomainProtocol extension for <domain:info>
   responses for .org.  The extension tells the
   registrar in which registry protocol the domain
   is based to see if the OxrsTransfer extension
   is required to transfer a domain from RRP to EPP.
   Example for this extension is included.  Note
   that the extension will not be present if the 
   protocol is RRP (i.e. EPP is the default).

liberty-rtk-addon-0.2.0 - Mar 27, 2003 (released to PIR)

 + Added OxrsTransfer extension for the transfer
   of .org domains from RRP-based registrars to
   EPP-based registrars.  The extension permits 
   the specification of EPP contacts to be
   assigned to the domain once the transfer is
   approved.
 + Updated the older unspec classes
   to use the epp02 package tree from the RTK

liberty-rtk-addon-0.1.3 - Oct 23, 2001

 + Changed trademark date data type from Date
   to String because it's free text in the 
   registry.
